This program requires the use of the Intel Realsense T265 camera which,leveraging 
its combined camera and imu, allows for precise positional data to be acquired.

This program requires Python 3.7 or below as pyrealsense2, which is a necessary dependency, is only compatible with those versions. 
```
pip install pyrealsense2
```
