This program requires the use of the Intel Realsense T265 camera, which, leveraging 
its combined camera and imu, allows for precise positional data to be aquired.

This version differs from the other in the different branch in when it writes to the disk, with this version running 1.23% faster than the other one. NOTE: If running on a hard disk, the difference will be much more pronounced. 

To modify contents, CMake is required. For more information on how to use CMake,
please visit the CMake website for instructional tutorials. Feel free to reach
out to me if you have any questions.
